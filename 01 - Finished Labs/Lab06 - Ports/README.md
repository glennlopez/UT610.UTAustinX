Lab6_BranchingFunctionsDelays

Learning Objectives
=================
The chapter covers the purpose of parallel ports, how to program them using memory-mapped I/O, and initialization rituals. We will learn how to access I/O registers in a friendly manner. We will test the system by single-stepping in the simulator, and we will observe the running system using a logic analyzer.

Learning Objectives:
=================
* Know what is a parallel port
* Learn how a pin can be either input or output as specified by the direction register
* Understand the steps required to initialize a parallel port
* Learn how to access I/O registers in a friendly manner
* Know how to read data from an input port
* Learn how to write data to an output port
* Know how to use the logic analyzer in the simulator
