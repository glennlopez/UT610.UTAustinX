STARTER PROJECT
=================
Lab8_SwitchLEDinterface

Learning Objectives
=================

We couldn’t wait to show you how much fun it is to make the microcontroller interact with real physical devices. So in this section we will take a short side step from the business of concepts and theories to teach you how to connect switches and LEDs to the microcontroller. We will use switches to input data and use LEDs to output results. In this chapter, we will illustrate the design, construction and testing of an embedded system. The switch LED and LaunchPad will then be combined to create a system. You will need a solid understanding of Ohm's Law, so you may need to review current, voltage, power, and resistance from Chapter 3.

Learning Objectives:
=================

* Understanding basic circuit elements like source, ground, and resistors.
* Understanding how switches and LEDs work.                      
* Application of Ohm’s Law
* Analog circuit design and construction on a solderless breadboard
* Interfacing switches and LEDs to a microcontroller
* Programming simple logic.
